## ðŸ”¹ Data Cleaning
Steps performed:
1. Converted `discounted_price` and `actual_price` from strings like `â‚¹399` â†’ numeric `399`.  
2. Converted `discount_percentage` from `"64%"` â†’ numeric `64`.  
3. Converted `rating` to float.  
4. Converted `rating_count` from `"24,269"` â†’ `24269`.  
5. Extracted `main_category` from `category` column.  

âœ… Final cleaned dataset saved as **`amazon_cleaned.csv`**.

## ðŸ”¹ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key questions explored:
- Which are the **top 10 categories** by number of products?  
- What are the **average ratings and discounts per category**?  
- How are **discounts distributed** across products?  
- Do higher discounts mean higher sales (rating_count)?  
- Which products are the **most popular** and **best-rated**?

---

## ðŸ”¹ Key Insights
- **Clothing & Electronics** dominate product listings.  
- Average discount across products was **~45%**, but heavy discounts did not always correlate with high ratings.  
- Some categories like **Books** maintained very high ratings even with lower discounts.  
- Identified **top-selling categories & products** based on rating count.
